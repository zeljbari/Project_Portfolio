Retail stores such as snack chains offer a variety of products for sale and collect data on sales. This project attempts to extract useful business insights from the data for store managers and the marketing department to make decisions to boost sales.

The data has weekly information on price and promotions of products (e.g., whether a product was assigned a special store display, or was in an in-store circular, or had a temporary price reduction). We want to examine the effects of these pricing and promotion strategies on total spend for that product, number of households who purchased that product, and the number of store visits. We are interested in answers to the following questions:

1. What is the effect of promotions, displays, or being featured in the circular on product sales (spend), unit sales, and number of household purchasers? 
2. How do the above effects vary by product categories (cold cereals, frozen pizza, bag snacks) and store segments (mainstream, upscale, value)? 
3. What are the five most price elastic and five least price elastic products? Price elasticity is the change in sales for unit change in product price? 
4. As the retailer, which products would you lower the price to maximize (a) product sales and (b) unit sales, and why?
