# Lung Cancer Survival Analysis

This project analyzes data from a Veteran's Administration Lung Cancer Trial, where 137 patients with advanced, inoperable lung cancer were treated with chemotherapy (standard treatment) vs chemotherapy combined with a new drug (test treatment). The objective is to do a survival analysis on this data.

1. Compute a Kaplan-Meier survival graphs for patients with the test vs standard treatment. Use this output to assess:

What is the probability that the patient will survive for 1 year (365 days) and 6 months (183 days) on the standard treatment vs the test treatment?
What is the mean number of days where a patient can be expected to survive if they are on the standard vs the test treatment?

2. Create three semi-parametric and parametric models to estimate the marginal effects of relevant predictors on survival outcomes. Interpret the coefficients of these models to explain the precise effects of age and months of diagnosis on survival probabilities of patients with standard and test treatments.
