# Project Description

In this project, our team proposed an add-on tool to the existing USF Schedule Planner System. 
The goal of the projects was to understand the Software Development Life Cycle by writing the full SDIP document using the Waterfall methodology for an idea of our choosing.
The secondary objective was to be able to coordinate and work as a team to succesfully propose and execute our plan while meeting all deadlines.
